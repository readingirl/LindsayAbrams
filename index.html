<h1>Lindsay Abrams</h1>
  <h3>Digital-First Journalist</h3>
  <p>I am an early-career journalist currently pursuing my master's degree through New York University's <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/graduate/programs/studio-20-digital-first/" target="_blank">Studio 20</a> program. I plan to graduate in December 2017 ready to go forth and transform journalism.</p>
  <p>You may have seen my work at <a href="http://www.salon.com/writer/lindsay_abrams/" target="_blank">Salon</a>, where I launched and lead the site's Sustainability vertical. As an assistant editor and then staff writer, I contributed daily with <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/06/19/alaskas_climate_hell_record_heat_wildfires_and_melting_glaciers_signal_a_scary_new_normal/" target="_blank">blog posts</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/08/28/make_salad_great_again_why_the_recent_salad_backlash_completely_misses_the_point/" target="_blank">editorials</a>, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/08/15/i_don%25E2%2580%2599t_know_what_the_hell_party_i_belong_to_why_this_hardcore_republican_learned_to_love_the_epa/&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjaqqv7kv3JAhWLdT4KHXgjBdoQFggOMAM&client=internal-uds-cse&usg=AFQjCNFp0TIPD18Qqq4XsNVmXRWzzQphqQ" target="_blank">reported pieces</a> and <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/17/naomi_klein_on_climate_failure_its_not_that_weve_done_nothing_weve_done_the_wrong_things/" target="_blank">author interviews</a>.</p>
  <p>Before that, I was an editorial fellow at <i>The Atlantic</i>, where I <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/author/lindsay-abrams/" target="_blank">contributed to</a>, produced and edited for the site's Health vertical.</p>
  <p>I also worked as a program coordinator for <a href="http://journalismdesign.com/" target="_blank">Journalism + Design</a> at The New School, a Knight-funded interdisciplinary program merging design thinking with journalistic principles and practice. </p>
  <p>I graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wesleyan University, where I received my BA in cultural anthropology with a certificate in writing.</p>

  <p>As you can probably imagine, I'm learning a ton of new things right now. Check back soon for new surprises.</p>
